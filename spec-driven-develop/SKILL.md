# Spec-Driven Develop

You are executing the **Spec-Driven Development** workflow — a standardized pre-development pipeline for large-scale complex tasks. Your job is to complete all preparation phases before any actual coding begins, ensuring the project has full analysis, a clear plan, trackable progress documents, and a task-specific SKILL.

## Before You Begin: Cross-Conversation Continuity Check

**CRITICAL**: Before starting any phase, check if `docs/progress/MASTER.md` already exists in the project.

- If it **exists**: Read it immediately. You are resuming an in-progress task. Identify which phase you are in, what has been completed, and continue from the exact point where the previous conversation left off. Do NOT restart from Phase 0.
- If it **does not exist**: This is a fresh start. Proceed to Phase 0.

---

## Phase 0: Intent Recognition & Confirmation

**Goal**: Understand exactly what the user wants to accomplish and eliminate all ambiguity.

**Actions**:

1. Identify the user's core intent from their message. Extract:
   - The type of transformation (language migration, framework change, architecture overhaul, new feature development, etc.)
   - The target state (e.g., "rewrite in Rust", "migrate to microservices")
   - Any constraints or preferences mentioned

2. Ask the user structured clarifying questions. At minimum, confirm:
   - **Scope**: Which parts of the project are in scope? The entire codebase or specific modules?
   - **Target**: What is the target technology/architecture/state?
   - **Constraints**: Are there hard constraints (timeline, backward compatibility, specific libraries, deployment targets)?
   - **Priorities**: What matters most — performance, maintainability, feature parity, or something else?

3. Summarize your understanding back to the user and get explicit confirmation before proceeding.

**Output**: A clear, confirmed task definition that will guide all subsequent phases.

## Phase 1: Deep Project Analysis

**Goal**: Build a comprehensive understanding of the current codebase.

**Actions**:

1. Analyze the project systematically:
   - Project structure and directory layout
   - Technology stack (languages, frameworks, build tools, dependency managers)
   - Entry points and build/run commands
   - Module inventory: each module's responsibility, public API surface, and approximate size
   - Dependency graph: internal module dependencies and external library dependencies
   - Code patterns: architectural patterns, design patterns, coding conventions in use

2. Assess transformation-specific concerns:
   - Which modules will be most challenging to transform?
   - What are the key risks (complex algorithms, platform-specific code, tight coupling)?
   - Are there external integration points that constrain the approach?

3. Write analysis documents to `docs/analysis/`:
   - `project-overview.md` — Architecture, tech stack, entry points, build system
   - `module-inventory.md` — Every module with: responsibility, dependencies, size, complexity rating
   - `risk-assessment.md` — Technical risks, compatibility risks, complexity hotspots

**On Claude Code**: If available, launch `project-analyzer` sub-agents in parallel to speed up analysis across different areas of the codebase.

**Output**: Complete `docs/analysis/` directory with three documents.

---

## Phase 2: Task Decomposition

**Goal**: Break down the transformation into manageable, trackable tasks organized in phases.

**Actions**:

1. Design a phased approach based on the analysis:
   - Identify natural phase boundaries (e.g., core libraries first, then application layer, then integrations)
   - Order phases by dependency: foundational components before dependent ones
   - Each phase should be independently testable/verifiable

2. For each phase, define concrete tasks. Each task must have:
   - A clear description of what to do
   - Priority level (P0/P1/P2)
   - Estimated effort (S/M/L/XL)
   - Dependencies on other tasks
   - Acceptance criteria: how to verify the task is done

3. Map dependencies between tasks and phases using a Mermaid diagram.

4. Define milestones: meaningful checkpoints where the project reaches a demonstrably better state.

5. Write planning documents to `docs/plan/`:
   - `task-breakdown.md` — All phases and tasks with full detail
   - `dependency-graph.md` — Mermaid diagram showing task/phase dependencies
   - `milestones.md` — Milestone definitions with target criteria

**On Claude Code**: If available, launch `task-architect` sub-agents to explore different decomposition strategies in parallel.

**Output**: Complete `docs/plan/` directory with three documents.

---

## Phase 3: Progress Tracking Documentation

**Goal**: Create a document-driven progress tracking system that survives across conversations.

**Actions**:

1. Create the **master control file** `docs/progress/MASTER.md` with:
   - Task name and description (from Phase 0)
   - Link to each analysis document
   - Link to each plan document
   - A summary table of all phases with completion percentage
   - Links to each phase's detailed progress file
   - A "Current Status" section indicating which phase/task is active
   - A "Next Steps" section for the agent to quickly orient itself

2. Create **one detailed progress file per phase**: `docs/progress/phase-N-<short-name>.md`
   - Each file contains the phase's tasks as checkbox items: `- [ ] Task description`
   - Include acceptance criteria inline for each task
   - Include a "Notes" section for recording decisions, blockers, and context

3. The MASTER.md format must follow this convention:
   - Phases use the format: `- [ ] Phase N: <name> (0/X tasks) [details](./phase-N-<name>.md)`
   - When a phase is fully done: `- [x] Phase N: <name> (X/X tasks) [details](./phase-N-<name>.md)`
   - The "Current Status" section is updated by the agent at the start and end of each work session

**Output**: Complete `docs/progress/` directory with MASTER.md and per-phase detail files.

---

## Phase 4: Task-Specific Sub-SKILL Generation

**Goal**: Create a SKILL tailored to this specific task, encoding the interaction patterns and development standards needed for the actual implementation work.

**Actions**:

1. Ask the user where to install the sub-SKILL:
   - **Project-level** (e.g., `.cursor/skills/` or project-local) — tied to this project, discarded when done
   - **Global-level** (e.g., `~/.cursor/skills/` or `~/.codex/skills/`) — persists across projects

2. Determine what the sub-SKILL should contain:
   - Task-specific coding standards and conventions for the target technology
   - The cross-conversation continuity protocol (read MASTER.md first)
   - Guidance on how to update progress documents after completing each task
   - Phase-specific instructions relevant to the transformation type
   - The cleanup trigger: when all tasks are done, initiate Phase 6

3. **Delegate creation to the platform's native skill-creator**:
   - On **Claude Code** or **Codex**: Invoke the platform's built-in `skill-creator` skill, providing it with the task context, the desired skill name, description, and content outline. Let the native tool handle the actual file generation and installation.
   - On **Cursor**: If a skill-creator skill is available, use it. Otherwise, create the SKILL.md directly following the standard frontmatter + markdown format and place it in the chosen directory.

4. The generated sub-SKILL should instruct the agent to:
   - Always read `docs/progress/MASTER.md` at the start of every conversation
   - Update the checkbox status in the relevant phase file after completing each task
   - Update the completion count and "Current Status" in MASTER.md
   - When all checkboxes are checked, trigger Phase 6 (Cleanup)

**Output**: A task-specific SKILL installed at the user's chosen location.

---

## Phase 5: Handoff & Summary

**Goal**: Present all preparation artifacts to the user and confirm readiness to begin development.

**Actions**:

1. Present a structured summary to the user:
   - Task definition (from Phase 0)
   - Key findings from analysis (high-level, from Phase 1)
   - Phased plan overview with task counts (from Phase 2)
   - Progress tracking system description (from Phase 3)
   - Sub-SKILL name and installation location (from Phase 4)

2. List all generated artifacts:
   - `docs/analysis/project-overview.md`
   - `docs/analysis/module-inventory.md`
   - `docs/analysis/risk-assessment.md`
   - `docs/plan/task-breakdown.md`
   - `docs/plan/dependency-graph.md`
   - `docs/plan/milestones.md`
   - `docs/progress/MASTER.md`
   - `docs/progress/phase-N-*.md` (one per phase)
   - The generated sub-SKILL

3. Ask the user: "All preparation is complete. Ready to begin Phase 1 development?"

**Output**: User confirmation to proceed with actual implementation.

---

## Phase 6: Cleanup

**Trigger**: This phase activates when ALL checkboxes in `docs/progress/MASTER.md` are marked complete (`[x]`).

**Goal**: Clean up temporary artifacts while preserving anything the user wants to keep.

**Actions**:

1. Announce to the user that all tasks have been completed. Congratulate them.

2. List all artifacts that were generated during this workflow:
   - The entire `docs/` directory tree
   - The task-specific sub-SKILL (name and location)
   - Any other temporary files created during development

3. Ask the user explicitly: "Which of these would you like to keep? Everything else will be removed."
   - Present as a checklist so the user can easily pick items to preserve
   - Common choices to highlight: analysis docs (useful as project documentation), the sub-SKILL (if reusable)

4. Delete the artifacts the user chose not to keep:
   - Remove unchecked docs files/directories
   - Uninstall/delete the sub-SKILL if not kept
   - If the user keeps nothing, remove the entire `docs/` directory

5. If any artifacts were preserved, suggest to the user that they might want to commit them to version control.

**Output**: A clean project with only the artifacts the user chose to keep.

## Important Behavioral Rules

1. **Never skip phases**. Even if you think a phase is unnecessary, at minimum create a lightweight version of its outputs.

2. **Always confirm with the user** before proceeding to the next phase. Each phase boundary is a checkpoint.

3. **Document everything**. If you make a decision, record it in the relevant progress file's "Notes" section.

4. **Progress updates are mandatory**. After completing any task, immediately update the checkbox in the phase file AND the completion count in MASTER.md.

5. **New conversation = read MASTER.md first**. This is non-negotiable. The master file is your memory across conversations.

6. **Respect the user's time**. Keep summaries concise. Use bullet points and tables, not walls of text.

7. **Cleanup is not optional**. When all tasks are done, always enter Phase 6. Don't leave temporary artifacts behind.
